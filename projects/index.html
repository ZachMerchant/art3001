           <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
           I am an interdisciplinary artist currently focusing on 3D modeling and animation. I enjoy making physical sculptures but, there are limitations to what I can create physically. Cost and actual physics being the main limitations. This is why I have been focusing on working in virtual space because I am free of these limitations. I do not have to worry about cost, weight, gravity, or how large of a creation I make. I am free to make magical constructs that defy real-world logic and seemingly float about a space.

           <h2>Project Statement</h2>
           This semester my goal was to make 3D sculptures that captured peoples imaginations and gave them an escape.

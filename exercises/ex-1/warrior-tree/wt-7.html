        As you and Tiebur walk outside of the tavern, Tiebur stops and places his hand on your shoulder and says,"Here is a map on how to get to the ruins of the outpost. Follow them closely there are reports that kabolds and goblins have been spotted in the woods near the woods." Tiebur pulls a scroll from his pouch and goes to hand it to you.

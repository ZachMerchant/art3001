        You are awakened by a bright light. As you open your eyes you seem to be laying on a pile of hay in a barn and not the room you paid for at the inn. As you scan the area you see a tall, muscular woman leaning up against the door frame of the open door. "So you are the one who paid for the cask of wine and got my Husband drunk," she snears. "Now, get out of Thrushridge before I see if you can fly." She walks towards you. Her eyes feel like they are stabbing you in your soul. She throws your equipment at your feet. "Don't bother looking for your coin, I took it to pay back the damage you and Lo'Mar caused."

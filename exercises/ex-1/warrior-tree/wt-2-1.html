            <p>“Let us get some drinks and I’ll tell you all I know.” whispers Ashebourne. Ashebourne calls to the barkeep to bring over the food and drink. “Rumor has it the fort was built over the ruins of an old dwarven castle. Tagnus king of the dwarven kingdom of Stoneloch built the fort as an outpost to warn of possible invaders from Gilmen to the south. Tagnus was no fool and knew that the relic would not be safe in Stoneloch if they were ever attacked. So it is likely that Tagnus had the relic placed in the dungeons under the old castle. If the rumors are true when King Galanor’s forces laid siege to the mountain kingdom. Tagnus withdrew his forces from the fort abandoning it and the relic.” Ashebourne smiles as the food is placed on the table.</p>

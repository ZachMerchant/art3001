        It takes you about 4 hours to get to the split in the road. There is a sign post with three signs hanging from it. West to Sandpoint, South to Thrushridge, and West to Halfhill. The grass has grown high around the base of the post. A forest grows to the north, but you can make out a path through the trees.

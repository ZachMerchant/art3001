        The Hawk's Roost Inn sits right next to the cliff. You enter and there are not many people inside. You pay for a room. The inn keeper tell you,"Find a table and I'll bring you out a bowl of stew." You find a table near the back and the inn keeper brings out some hearty stew and ale to drink. As you enjoy your meal the Bard in the cornor starts to play.

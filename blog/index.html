    <p>I am trying to pace myself better this semester. Admittedly, it hasnâ€™t gone so well. I keep getting distracted by the smallest of things that is not my school work. I am not much for large groups of people but after almost a year of this pandemic really want to just go somewhere crowded. I have been spending most of my time trying to figure out what I am going to be doing in my studio art class. It is going to be 3D modeling just not sure on many aspects of it other than somewhat abstract 3D models in an interactive gallery. </p>

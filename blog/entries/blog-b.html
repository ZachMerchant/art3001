    <p>I am having way to much fun with Exercise 1. It is based off one of my D&D campaignes. I can't wait to get more of the story written out. Color coding everything is time consuming but worth it. It is going to help so much when I go to write out the other trees. I hope I can get it have the feel of the old text adventure games like Zork. Would be awesome if I could have it so that you could actually interact with it like Zork and other text adventures where you type in what you want to do and it picks up on the key words and responds to the users imput.</p>

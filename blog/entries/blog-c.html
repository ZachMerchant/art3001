        This last week has not been great. I have not been sleeping well which, is making it hard to focus. I wish I could dedicate more time to just expanding exercise 1. I have been thinking about turning it into its own project. I did play around with a new website to create pixel sprites for Dungeon Crawl. The site even lets you create .gif's of your sprites. Can't wait to until I can get more time to play around with it.
